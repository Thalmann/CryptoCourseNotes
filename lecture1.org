* Intro
** SSL/TLS no eavesdropping
** SSL/TLS has two parts:
*** Handshake protocol
**** Exchange key by public key cryptography
*** Communication between the two - Record layer
**** Encrypted messages with the key
** Symmetric Encryption
*** Alice and Bob share a secret key
*** Everything else is public
*** Only use known encryption algorithms
** Single use key is a one time key 
*** used for instance for encrypted emails
** Multi use key - many time key
*** Same key for many files
*** Is more complex
** Crypto is useless when:
*** Implemented with bugs - channel attacks
*** Social engineering attacks etc.
*** Do not invent it urself!
* What is Cryptography
** Secure key establishment
** Secure communication
** Digital Signature
** Mix net for instance tor project
** Protocols
